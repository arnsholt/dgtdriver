/**

 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Background for the library, since it motivates some of the design choices.</li>
 *     <li>An immutable style without getters</li>
 *     <li>Some high-level concepts about the DGT boards and how they work.
 *     Notably, stress that the board has a fixed idea of where A1 and H8 is,
 *     which may or may not correspond to the game coordinates, depending on
 *     which side the players are sitting on.</li>
